              Front end development frameworks are instrumental in web development as they help to structure and simplify the process of creating a website. Front end developers use these frameworks to quickly build a website's graphical user interface (GUI) and enable single-page web applications.
              <br><br>
              A website developed using a front end framework is generally more efficient and secure, as the code is uniform and consistent. In addition, frameworks often come with many reusable components, which saves development time and resources.
              <br><br>
              To understand what front end frameworks are, you first need to know what the front end is. The front end of a website or application is the client side â€“ the part that users interact with. This includes the design, layout, user experience (UX), and any interactive elements, such as forms and buttons.
              <br><br>
              Front end frameworks are sets of pre-written code that provide developers with a scalable and maintainable structure for creating user interfaces more efficiently. They contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that developers can reuse in other projects, helping to keep the codebase consistent and organized.
              <br><br>
  
              These web development frameworks provide structure to the development process and make it easier to write consistent and well-organized code.
              <br><br>
  
              Some of the tasks that front end frameworks help with include:
  
              Generating HTML and CSS code
              Creating responsive designs that are optimized for multiple devices
              Creating a consistent look and feel across platforms
              Automating repetitive tasks such as modification, compression, and optimization
              Managing and updating code

              <strong>Bootstrap is a free, open source front-end development framework</strong>. It is used for the creation of websites and web apps. Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of syntax for template designs.
              <br><br>
              As a framework, Bootstrap includes the basics for responsive web development, so developers only need to insert the code into a pre-defined grid system. The Bootstrap framework is built on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. Web developers using Bootstrap can build websites much faster without spending time worrying about basic commands and functions.

              <strong>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) framework.</strong> It has predefined classes that you can use to build and design web pages directly in your markup. It lets you write CSS in your HTML in the form of predefined classes. 
              <br><br>
              Tailwind CSS is another framework that is slowly gaining popularity and trying to become a competitor to the already existing giants of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Materialize, and Bulma. Tailwind is written utility first instead of semantic first which can be a little challenging for the beginners to comprehend but utility CSS has its own separate fan base. 
              <br><br>
              For a beginner developer, Tailwind CSS proves to be the most productive CSS framework. It has a smaller bundle size and is completely configurable and customisable.

              <strong>Foundation, as the tagline says, is the most advanced responsible front end framework in the world.</strong> Bootstrap and Foundation are necks to neck in the race of becoming the best framework for the use of developers all around. Foundation was built to support rails and is inspired largely by its principles.
              <br><br> 
              Here is a code snippet from the official Foundation docs which will help you understand how the grid system works in Foundation: 
              <br><br>
              Foundation is a CSS framework for both the styling of websites and emails. Foundation gives the developer complete control over how he wants his website to appear. There are certain components that are more than just a UI layout within Foundation which becomes a boon for a large number of front-end developers when their projects are supposed to be scaled at a huge level.  
              <br><br>
              A few developers know about Foundation with the presence of Bootstrap in the scene which makes it difficult to find skilled people who would know how to utilise the potential of Foundation to the fullest.
